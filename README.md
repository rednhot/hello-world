Temporary educational-purpose repository

Passionate about everything which concerns computers and their unions, how do they work, communicate with each other.
Mostly I like more low-level languages such as assembly and C, as they provde a programmer with much more power than
any other high-level language. Moreoever, they can support your intetion to understand how actually everything works.

Also, I like eating delicious food and watching films, drinking coca-cola.
